# DEFAULT BUTTON CONFIGURATION FOR bl-exit
#
# USING THE CLASSICAL STYLE
# -------------------------
#
# CASE:
#   Use only lowercase in the BUTTONS section
#
# WARNING:
#   Do not overwrite this file.
#   It is a Debian conf file and may be changed by the package manager when
#   a new version of bunsen-utilities is released.
#
# CONFIGURATION:
#   To configure bl-exit buttons, copy this file to
#
#      "$HOME/.config/bl-exit/bl-exitrc"
#
#   and edit it according to your wishes.
#
#   It is possible to group configurations for several buttons by adding a
#      [default]
#   section. All buttons that do not have a specific section will take the
#   show and onerror values from this default section.
#   show can take the values always | never | maybe
#
#     maybe:
#       the button will be shown and clickable when the action is
#       possible. When the action is not possible (e.g. suspend when
#       no swap file is present) the button will be inactive.
#
#   onerror can take the values visual | novisual for feedback on error.
#
# USING THE MODERN STYLE
# ----------------------
#
# ICONS:
#   Icon images are installed in "/usr/share/images/bunsen/exit/dark"
#   You can use your own images by placing them in a directory of your
#   choice in your HOME directory. We recommend "~/.local/share/bl-exit",
#   but you are free to choose any directory you want.
#   To activate those images, edit the 'iconpath' configuration option
#   to:
#     iconpath=~/.local/share/bl-exit:/usr/share/images/bunsen/exit/light
#
#   This path is searched from left to right - just like PATH - to find
#   your configured images.
#
# THEMES:
#   The height of the bl-exit window will not be displayed less than the icon height.
#   The default dark and light theme icons are 100x100px.
#   NOTE: We install a "light" directory containing light icons for a dark theme
#         and a 'dark' directory containing dark icons for a light theme.
#         However, you are free to name your icon directory as you want and you can
#         use any directory for any theme, by editing the 'iconpath' configuration
#         option for that theme appropriately.
#
# STYLE:
#   When the [style] section is not present or the combination of the values
#   of options 'dir' and 'rcfile' point to a non-existent file, the buttons
#   will take colors from the active gtk theme.
#   So you can keep the section [style] and just switch the value of 'rcfile'
#   from an existent file to 'None' for instance - to switch from a custom
#   style to the current active gtk theme. (presuming there is no file 'None'
#   in the directory 'dir')
#
#     non-existing rcfile  --> use current GTK theme
#     existing rcfile      --> use custom colors
#
#   EDIT:
#     To switch to the classic button layout, you can now set the 'theme'
#     entry in the [theme] section to 'classic'
#
#   To use custom styles, you MUST
#      - create a subdirectory in "$HOME/.config/bl-exit"
#      - specify that subdirectory in entry 'dir' of section [style] as an absolute path
#      - specify the filename in entry 'rcfile' of section [style]
#
#   We install example custom styles in "/etc/bl-exit/styles" that you can copy
#   to "$HOME/.config/bl-exit/"...
